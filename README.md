# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game :PYHTON

## Overview
This repository contains a simple implementation of the classic game Rock, Paper, Scissors in Python. The game is designed to be played in the command line, where the user competes against the computer. The computer's choice is randomly generated using Python's random module.

## Game Rules
- Rock smashes scissors.
- Paper covers rock.
- Scissors cut paper.

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the game script.
4. Run the script using Python.

## Code Structure
The game is structured in a simple loop that continues until the user decides to quit. The computer's choice is randomly generated at the start of each loop iteration. The user is prompted to enter their choice, and the game determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.

## Key Components
- Random Choice Generation: The computer's choice is generated using `random.randint(0, 2)`, which selects a random index from the `options` list.
- User Input: The user's choice is captured using the `input()` function.
- Game Logic: The game logic determines the winner based on the rules of Rock, Paper, Scissors.
